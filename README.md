# **In the workplace**

Paws & Whiskers
is a successful pet shop that caters to a loyal customer base with a wide range of products, including pet food, toys, grooming supplies, and live animals. As the business expands, it faces growing operational challenges, especially in managing increasing volumes of sales, customer, and inventory data. The current reliance on manual data entry and spreadsheets limits the company's ability to extract valuable insights, quickly respond to market trends, and optimize inventory levels.
First up have quickly stated which data laws and regulations you need to use and then we will go into the right storage and azure programmes for you.
Data Laws and Regulations

GDPR Compliance, Data Protection Act (DPA) 2018 and Other Industry Standards

There are many aspects to GDPR, but it boils down to being clear and ethical with the personal data you process treating it as you'd treat something valuable of your own. Some initial practical steps you can take to get GDPR compliant are:
❖ Check which of your products or services collect and process personal data 
❖  ensure you have a legal basis for the processing of personal data 
❖ ensure you can comply with the obligations to your customers as set out in the GDPR (such as the right of access and the right of erasure)
Personal data about EU-based people (absolutely all of it): This includes your customers, employees, suppliers and any other individual you collect personal data from. Personal data includes names, contacts, medical information, credit card or bank account details, and more.

How you collect personal data
❖ You can only collect personal data if you have a legal reason to do so. You might need it for a sales contract, for example. Your customer may have asked you to send them some information about your product or service. In all cases, you must make it clear what the personal data will be used for – and only use it for that purpose.
❖ User contracts and terms and conditions (on websites, for example): These need to be simple, clear and easy to understand – with no complicated legal text.
The right to know
❖ Individuals can ask a business what information is being held about them. This isn’t a new right, but organisations must now respond within one month and can’t charge a fee (which they used to be able to do).
❖ The right to erasure: Customers can ask a company to delete all stored personal data about them, unless the company needs to keep that information for legal reasons, such as tax.
❖Data portability: Individuals can request a digital copy of their personal data to use however they like, including transitioning to a new service provider.
Data breach
❖ You’re obliged to report certain types of data breach to the relevant supervisory authority.
Theses are the main regulation within the UK you need to comply with:
❖ Data Protection Act 2018 (which incorporates the UK GDPR into UK law)
❖ Data Protection (Charges and Information) Regulations 2018 
❖ 2003 Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations; and 
❖ Freedom of Information Act 2000. 
 
To address these challenges the company must aim to transition its data management and analytics processes to Microsoft Azure.
❖ Centralize Data Storage: Consolidate all data in a secure, cloud-based environment to eliminate fragmented data silos.
❖ Enhance Data Analysis Capabilities: Utilize Azure's powerful analytics tools to gain actionable insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and inventory management.
❖ Streamline Operations: Automate data collection and integration to reduce manual effort and minimize the risk of human error.
❖ Ensure Compliance: Align with data protection laws to safeguard customer trust and avoid legal penalties.

Azure Service Recommendations

Data Storage- Unstructured Data- Social media files -> Connect Microsoft Azure -> Upload data or connect via API -> Blob data is categorised -> Categorised data put into lake in the form of containers -> Connect to data lake via a table or PowerBI

❖ Azure Blob Storage: A scalable, cost-effective solution for unstructured data like images, videos, and backups. It offers high scalability, low cost, and easy integration with Azure services.
❖ Azure SQL Database: A fully managed relational database service ideal for structured data. It provides built-in security, scalability, and supports complex queries.
Data Analysis Tools

❖ Azure Synapse Analytics: Combines data integration, big data, and data warehousing. It enables fast querying of large datasets and supports interactive dashboards and reports.
❖ Azure Machine Learning: Supports predictive analytics and machine learning models for deeper insights. Useful for customer segmentation, demand forecasting, and churn analysis.
Data Integration and Automation

Azure Data Factory: Automates data workflows, enabling data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) from various sources. It offers seamless integration, automation, and real-time monitoring.
Data Types and Data Modelling

Data Categories
❖ Customer Demographics: Names, addresses, emails, phone numbers.
❖ Transaction History: Purchase dates, product details, quantities, total amounts, payment methods.
❖ Pet Inventory: Types of pets, breeds, health details, availability status.
❖ Product Categories: Pet food, toys, accessories, health products.

Data Modelling Approach

❖ Tables and Relationships
❖ Customers, Transactions, Inventory, Products.
❖ Star Schema for Analytics
❖ A star schema with a Fact Table (Sales) and Dimension Tables (Customers, Products, Time) for detailed reports.

Data Storage Formats and Structures in Azure
Data Formats

❖ CSV: For raw data imports, suitable for initial data ingestion.
❖ JSON: For structured data exchanges, particularly with APIs.
❖ Parquet: Optimised for analytical workloads, efficient storage, and fast querying.
Data Security and Encryption
❖ Encryption: Azure provides encryption for data at rest and in transit.
❖ Role-Based Access Control : Ensures only authorized users can access sensitive information.
❖ Azure Key Vault: Manages encryption keys and secrets securely.
Additional Considerations
Backup and Disaster Recovery
❖ Azure Backup: Automatically backs up critical data with flexible retention policies.
❖ Azure Site Recovery: Provides continuous data replication for minimal downtime and data loss.
Data Visualization
❖ Power BI: Creates dynamic, interactive dashboards for real-time insights, integrating seamlessly with Azure Synapse and SQL databases.
Future Scalability
❖ Microsoft Azure is built to adapt to business growth with Horizontal Scaling, Vertical Scaling and Global Reach

Conclusion
Migrating to Microsoft Azure will transform "Paws & Whiskers'" data management and analytics capabilities. By harnessing Azure's robust storage, automation, and analytics tools, the business can streamline its operations, derive valuable insights, and adhere to data protection regulations.
